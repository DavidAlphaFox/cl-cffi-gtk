cl-cffi-gtk is a Lisp binding to the GTK+ (GIMP Toolkit) which is a library
for creating graphical user interfaces.

It is licensed using the LGPL which has been adopted with a preamble that
clarifies the terms for use with Lisp programs and is referred as the LLGPL.

This work is based on the cl-gtk2 library which has been developed by
Kalyanov Dmitry and already is a fairly complete Lisp binding to GTK+.

The focus of this work is to document the library more complete and to
do the implementation as consistent as possible. Most informations about GTK+
can be gained by reading the C documentation. Therefore, the C documentation
from www.gtk.org is included into the Lisp files to document the Lisp binding
to the GTK+ library.

Examples of the usage are included in demos and tutorial examples.
