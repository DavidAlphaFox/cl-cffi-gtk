cl-cffi-gtk is a Lisp binding to the GTK+ (GIMP Toolkit) which is a library
for creating graphical user interfaces.

It is licensed using the LGPL which has been adopted with a preamble that
clarifies the terms for use with Lisp programs and is referred as the LLGPL.

This work is based on the cl-gtk2 library which has been developed by
Kalyanov Dmitry and already is a fairly complete Lisp binding to GTK+.

The focus of this work is to document the library more complete and to
do the implementation as consistent as possible. Most informations about GTK+
can be gained by reading the C documentation. Therefore, the C documentation
from www.gtk.org is included into the Lisp files to document the Lisp binding
to the GTK+ library.

At this time, the library is developed and tested with SBCL 1.0.56 and
GTK+ 3.4.1 on a Linux system. Furthermore, the following libraries GLIB 2.32.1,
Pango 1.30.0, and Cairo 1.10.2 are loaded.

Examples of the usage are included in demos and tutorial examples. Start with
the tutorial to learn how to use the library.
