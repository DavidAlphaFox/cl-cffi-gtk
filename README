cl-cffi-gtk is a Lisp binding to GTK+ 3 (GIMP Toolkit) which is a library
for creating graphical user interfaces.

cl-cffi-gtk is licensed using the LGPL which has been adopted with a preamble
that clarifies the terms for use with Lisp programs and is referred as the
LLGPL.

This work is based on the cl-gtk2 library which has been developed by
Kalyanov Dmitry and already is a fairly complete Lisp binding to GTK+.

The focus of this work is to document the library more complete and to
do the implementation as consistent as possible. Most informations about GTK+
can be gained by reading the C documentation. Therefore, the C documentation
from http://www.gtk.org is included into the Lisp files to document the Lisp
binding to the GTK+ library. This documentation is also available online at
http://www.crategus.com/books/cl-cffi-gtk/

At this time, the library is developed and tested with SBCL 1.1.9 and
GTK+ 3.6.4 on a Linux system. Furthermore, the following libraries GLIB 2.36.0,
Pango 1.32.5, and Cairo 1.12.4 are loaded.

Examples of the usage are included in a gtk-demo and tutorial examples. Start
with the tutorial available online at
http://www.crategus.com/books/cl-gtk/gtk-tutorial.html to learn how to use the
library.
