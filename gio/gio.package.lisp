 "GIO is striving to provide a modern, easy-to-use VFS API that sits at the
  right level in the library stack, as well as other generally useful APIs for
  desktop applications (such as networking and D-Bus support). The goal is to
  overcome the shortcomings of GnomeVFS and provide an API that is so good that
  developers prefer it over raw POSIX calls. Among other things that means using
  GObject. It also means not cloning the POSIX API, but providing higher-level,
  document-centric interfaces.
  This is the API documentation of a Lisp binding to GIO. ")
