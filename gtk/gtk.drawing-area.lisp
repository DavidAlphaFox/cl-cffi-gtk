;;; Implemented Interfaces
;;;
;;; GtkDrawingArea implements AtkImplementorIface and GtkBuildable.
;;;
;;; Description
;;;
;;; The GtkDrawingArea widget is used for creating custom user interface
;;; elements. It's essentially a blank widget; you can draw on it. After
;;; creating a drawing area, the application may want to connect to:
;;;
;;;     Mouse and button press signals to respond to input from the user. (Use
;;;     gtk_widget_add_events() to enable events you wish to receive.)
;;;
;;;     The "realize" signal to take any necessary actions when the widget is
;;;     instantiated on a particular display. (Create GDK resources in response
;;;     to this signal.)
;;;
;;;     The "configure-event" signal to take any necessary actions when the
;;;     widget changes size.
;;;
;;;     The "draw" signal to handle redrawing the contents of the widget.
;;;
;;; The following code portion demonstrates using a drawing area to display a
;;; circle in the normal widget foreground color.
;;;
;;; Note that GDK automatically clears the exposed area to the background color
;;; before sending the expose event, and that drawing is implicitly clipped to
;;; the exposed area.
;;;
;;; Example 99. Simple GtkDrawingArea usage
;;;
;;;   gboolean
;;;   draw_callback (GtkWidget *widget, cairo_t *cr, gpointer data)
;;;   {
;;;     guint width, height;
;;;     GdkRGBA color;
;;;
;;;     width = gtk_widget_get_allocated_width (widget);
;;;     height = gtk_widget_get_allocated_height (widget);
;;;     cairo_arc (cr,
;;;                width / 2.0, height / 2.0,
;;;                MIN (width, height) / 2.0,
;;;                0, 2 * G_PI);
;;;
;;;     gtk_style_context_get_color (gtk_widget_get_style_context (widget),
;;;                                  0,
;;;                                  &color);
;;;     gdk_cairo_set_source_rgba (cr, &color);
;;;
;;;     cairo_fill (cr);
;;;
;;;    return FALSE;
;;;   }
;;;   [...]
;;;     GtkWidget *drawing_area = gtk_drawing_area_new ();
;;;     gtk_widget_set_size_request (drawing_area, 100, 100);
;;;     g_signal_connect (G_OBJECT (drawing_area), "draw",
;;;                       G_CALLBACK (draw_callback), NULL);
;;;
;;;
;;; Draw signals are normally delivered when a drawing area first comes
;;; onscreen, or when it's covered by another window and then uncovered. You can
;;; also force an expose event by adding to the "damage region" of the drawing
;;; area's window; gtk_widget_queue_draw_area() and gdk_window_invalidate_rect()
;;; are equally good ways to do this. You'll then get a draw signal for the
;;; invalid region.
;;;
;;; The available routines for drawing are documented on the GDK Drawing
;;; Primitives page and the cairo documentation.
;;;
;;; To receive mouse events on a drawing area, you will need to enable them with
;;; gtk_widget_add_events(). To receive keyboard events, you will need to set
;;; the "can-focus" property on the drawing area, and you should probably draw
;;; some user-visible indication that the drawing area is focused. Use
;;; gtk_widget_has_focus() in your expose event handler to decide whether to
;;; draw the focus indicator. See gtk_render_focus() for one way to draw focus.
