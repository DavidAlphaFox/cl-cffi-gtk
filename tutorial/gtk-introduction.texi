The @code{cl-cffi-gtk} library is a Lisp binding to GTK+ (GIMP Toolkit) which
is a library for creating graphical user interfaces.  Gtk+ is licensed using
the LGPL which has been adopted for the @code{cl-cffi-gtk} library with a
preamble that clarifies the terms for use with Lisp programs and is referred
as the LLGPL.

This work is based on the @code{cl-gtk2} library which has been developed by
Kalyanov Dmitry and already is a fairly complete Lisp binding to GTK+.  The
focus of the @code{cl-cffi-gtk} library is to document the Lisp library much
more complete and to do the implementation as consistent as possible.  Most
informations about GTK+ can be gained by reading the C documentation.
Therefore, the C documentation from @url{www.gtk.org} is included into the Lisp
files to document the Lisp binding to the GTK+ library.  This way the calling
conventions are easier to determine and missing functionality is easier to
detect.

At this time the Lisp library is developed using SBCL 1.0.56 on a Linux system
with the version GTK+ 3.2 of the C library.  In addition the library is tested
on windows with SBCL 1.0.54 and the version GTK+ 2.24.

The GTK+ library is called the GIMP toolkit because GTK+ was originally written
for developing the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), but GTK+ has now been
used in a large number of software projects, including the GNU Network Object
Model Environment (GNOME) project.  GTK+ is built on top of GDK (GIMP Drawing
Kit) which is basically a wrapper around the low-level functions for accessing
the underlying windowing functions (Xlib in the case of the X windows system),
and gdk-pixbuf, a library for client-side image manipulation.

GTK+ is essentially an object oriented application programmers interface (API).
Although written completely in C, GTK+ is implemented using the idea of classes
and callback functions (pointers to functions).

A third component is called GLib which contains replacements for standard
calls, as well as additional functions for handling linked lists, etc.  The
replacement functions are used to increase the portability of GTK+, as some
of the functions implemented here are not available or are non standard on other
Unixes such as g_strerror().  Some also contain enhancements to the libc 
versions, such as g_malloc() that has enhanced debugging utilities.

In version 2.0, GLib has picked up the type system which forms the foundation
for the class hierarchy of GTK+, the signal system which is used throughout
GTK+, a thread API which abstracts the different native thread APIs of the
various platforms and a facility for loading modules.

As the last component, GTK+ uses the Pango library for internationalized text
output.

This tutorial describes the Lisp interface to GTK+.  It is based on the official
GTK+ 2.0 Tutorial of the C implementation.
